# 📌 Information

This project is a fork of [ChargingWorkshop](https://github.com/RyensX/ChargingWorkshop), originally created by [RyensX](https://github.com/RyensX). I am not affiliated with the original author, and any modifications in this version are my own.

# 📝 About This Fork

- Translate the entire application into English to make it easier for everyone to use.
- Fixed a minor bug affecting the `tap-to-close` feature.
- The new `Unlock Style` feature replaces the previous `tap-to-close`, providing users with a smoother and more seamless unlocking experience.
- And a few other minor changes.

# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## 👉 Step 1. Download needed files

Go to [releases](https://github.com/YunyiKovsha/Charging_Workshop/releases/) page and download these files:
- `Charging_Workshop_2.5.apk`
- `resources.zip`
- `scbg_fhd+.png` (Optional, this is Shark Chan wallpaper)
- `animation_default.mp4` (Optional, this is Shark Chan live wallpaper)

## 👉 Step 2. Install `.apk` file

- No need to explain further, right?

## 👉 Step 3. Set-up resource files [IMPORTANT]

- The ultimate goal of this step is to place the resource files in the application's directory.
- In the `resources.zip` file you just downloaded, you can see 2 folders: `audio` and `video`.
- Use a file manager app that can access system directories, such as [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver), to extract two folders above to the following path:
  `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.su.charging/files/res/`
- The folder structure after completion is as follows:
  ```
  files/
  └── res/
      ├── audio/
      └── video/
  ```
- Once you've confirmed, open the app and enjoy!

## 👉 Step 4. Other things you can tinker with!

- Shark Chan wallpaper: Simply download `scbg_fhd+.png` and set it.
- Shark Chan live wallpaper: Download `animation_default.mp4` and use with [Video Live Wallpaper](https://github.com/cyunrei/Video-Live-Wallpaper) made by [Cyunrei](https://github.com/cyunrei).
